# Adopt Axtell for Lengnick

- employees are paid
	- equal shares 
	- of produced value (quantity * price).
		- **what if not all the output is sold end of month?** negative money?
			- should workers account for price charged by firm before they jump?
	- at end of month
- thus:
	- no owner class

- firm determines only vacancies 
- thus
	- no wage parameter

- firm determines price.

- if worker is connected with a vacant firm, and determines they can produce more value (per worker) there, they move.
- thus:
	- no search intensity.

- seller firms need to be reassigned after the start of every month.
	- but what about network relationships?

- produce once a month instead of every day.

- other axtell features
	- workers have productivity.
	- firms have production function.
	- workers value leisure.
	- workers can work partial effort.
		- workers can change effort.
			- SOLVE THE DERIVATIVE? no.
