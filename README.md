# Macroeconomic Agent-Based Model

A macroeconomy simulated with two types of software agents: households that decide whom to buy from and work for, and firms that decide headcount, wages, and prices. This is a [Lengnick](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2012.12.021) model, which shows that even without exogenous shocks, recessions can just emerge from economic agents temporarily failing to coordinate with each other.
