## Introduction

- Replicated @lengnick's macroeconomic agent-based model in Python with Mesa
- Reproduced endogenous business cycles without growth or aggregate shocks
- Reproduced various aggregate phenomena (Phillips curve, Beveridge curve)
- Some deviations in frequency and severity of downturns, and firm-level decisions

## Motivations for Agent-Based Macroeconomic Models

- Allows heterogeneity in agents unlike structural VAR or traditional DSGE models
- No assumptions of perfect foresight or equilibrium conditions unlike HANK models

## Contributions

- Converted @lengnick's Java model to Python in open-source repository
- Clarified ambiguities and inconsistencies in the model
- Added (skeletal) dashboard capabilities with Mesa's Solara-based modules

## Model Overview

- Two agent types: households and firms
- Two markets: consumer goods and labor
- Each step represents one day; 21 days = one month

## Model Parameters

```{r}
source("analysis.R")
```

Key parameters:

- $H = 1000$ households, $F = 100$ firms
- $n = 7$ firms in household's seller network
- Several other parameters governing price/wage adjustments, inventories, job search

## Parameters table

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| $\gamma$ | Months of labor market slack until wage cut.  | $24$ |
| $\delta$ | Upper-bound of wage adjustment.  | $0.019$ |
| $\underline{\phi}$ | Minimum desirable inventory (multiplier on units of goods demanded). | 0.25 |
| $\overline{\phi}$ | Maximum desirable inventory (multiplier on units of goods demanded). | 1 |
| $\underline{\rho}$ | Minimum desirable price (multiplier on "marginal cost"). | 1.025 |
| $\overline{\rho}$ | Maximum desirable price (multiplier on "marginal cost"). | 1.15 |
| $\theta$ | Probability firm considers changing price. | 0.75 |
| $\eta$ | Upper-bound of price adjustment. | 0.02 |
| $\psi_p$ | Probability household tries to switch seller for price. | 0.25 |
| $\psi_y$ | Probability household tries to switch seller for inventory. | 0.25 |
| $\xi$ | Minimum price decrease required to switch seller. | 0.01 |
| $\beta$ | Number of firms visited when unemployed. | 5 |
| $\pi$ | Probability underpaid worker seeks new job. | 0.1 |
| $\alpha$ | Parameter for maximum consumption. | 0.9 |
| $\lambda$ | Production technology parameter. | 3 |
| $\chi$ | Parameter for precautionary buffer (multiplier on total payroll). | 0.1 |

## Monthly Actions: Firms

At the start of each month, firms:

1. Adjust wages based on vacancies
2. Adjust headcount based on whether inventory falls within some target multiple of last period's demand
3. Adjust prices, only if headcount was adjusted, and if it's not within some target multiple of marginal costs

## Monthly Actions: Households

At the start of each month, households:

1. Update seller networks based on prices and inventory
2. Seek new jobs if unemployed
3. Possibly seek better jobs if employed but underpaid
4. Plan consumption based on money and average prices

## Daily Actions

- Households buy and consume goods from their network
- Firms produce according to production function: $y_{fs} = \lambda l_{ft}$

## End of Month Actions

- Firms pay wages to employees
- Firms retain buffer for future wages
- Firms pay dividends to shareholders (all households) 
- Households adjust reservation wages

## Implementation Challenges

::: {.nonincremental}

- Omissions in original paper made replication difficult:
  - Initial step not specified
  - Unknown initial parameters (initial money, wages, prices)
  - Unclear definitions (demand, marginal cost)

## Key Differences in Results {incremental=false}

::: {.nonincremental}

- **Business cycles**: Less frequent but more severe in my replication
  - 10% unemployment vs. 4.5% in original

- **Unsatisfied demand**: Similar mode but fatter tails in replication

- **Phillips and Beveridge curves**: Similar patterns but different scales
  - Price changes mostly within $±1$ vs. $±4$ in original
  - Fewer vacancies in replication (max 20 vs. 80)

- **Price changes**: My distribution is multimodal with second peak at ~75%

- **Cross-correlations**: Negative correlation with price lags persists longer (18 months vs. 6 months)

:::

## Discussion

- Model has large parameter space despite "baseline" intent
  - 19 known + 6 unknown parameters
  - Many parameters difficult to estimate from real data

- Disequilibrium core to model makes some extensions difficult

- What I want to add next: modify search behaviors to incorporate tax policies and integrate model with tax calculators for policy forecasting
