## Introduction

In this paper, I replicate @lengnick's macroeconomic agent-based model in Python with the Mesa library. The original model is written in Java not open-source.

The paper is structured as follows. In @sec-model, I will first review the key components in the @lengnick MABM. In @sec-implment, I discuss issues I encountered when implementing the model, including ambiguities in @lengick and assumptions I have to make in response. @sec-output compares the output of my model to the original model. @sec-discuss discusses further issues with the model.

## Model {#sec-model}

The @lengick MABM consists of two agent types---households and firms---interacting in two markets---that for consumer goods and labor. The model is best described from (i) how it is initialized and (ii) what a full step comprises.

### Initialization

Each step represents a day. One month (denoted as $t$) elapses after every 21 days.

$H$ **singleton** households (indexed $h$) are first initialized,[^1] and then $F$ firms (indexed $f$). Each household forms a network of $n$ firms, from which the household will buy consumption goods when the model runs. Here I should note that all households and firms are permanent; there is no births or deaths for households, or entries or exits for firms.

[^1]: All households are singleton. They are called households throughout @lengnick. I adopt the same language.

Each household has a (monthly) reservation wage $w_{ht}$ that changes with time. This refers to the wage that households must be offered to take a job. For clarity, it is **not** an amount that households receive for being unemployed. The reservation wage is initially $w_{h0}$.

Households are endowed with money $m_{ht}|_{t=0} = m_{h0}$. Each firm initially sets per-good price $m_{f0}$. and monthly wage $w_{f0}$.

### One full step

At the start of each month (i.e., on day $s$ where $s \ \% \ 21 = 1$), the following actions are taken:

- If a firm had a vacancy in the previous month, it adjusts wages upwards. Conversely, if it has had **no** vacancies for the previous six months. The adjustment is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{ft} = w_{f,t-1} (1 \pm \mu)
\\ \mu  \sim U_{0, \delta}.
\end{aligned}
$$
* Firm makes production plans. Specifically, it adjusts the number of employees (or households) it employs. It does

Table: Known parameters. {#tbl-known}

| Parameter | Description | Value |
|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| $H$ | Number of households. | 1000 |
| $F$ | Number of firms.  | $H/10$ |
| $n$ | Number of firms that household maintains in sellers network.  | $7$ |
| $\delta$ | Upper-bound of wage adjustment.  | $0.019$ |


Table: Unknown parameters. {#tbl-unknown}
| Parameter | Description | Value |

| $w_{h0}$ | Initial reservation wage (monthly). | NA |



## Implementation Issues {#sec-implement}

- $w_h, m_{h0}, m_{f0}, w_{f0}$ is never defined.
- Some steps are skipped in the first instance.
- Initial hiring assignment.
- Initial production.
